## Can I explain what my code does?
My code implements a system using multiple components. These components include functions, classes, and data structures that work together to achieve the objective. Each segment of the code addresses specific tasks—whether that’s user input validation, data processing, or generating an output. These tasks are linked to create an end-to-end solution.

## What was my coding process?
I designed the form structure and visual layout, ensuring it was user-friendly and accessible. Next, I implemented the functionality for validation, focusing on modular and reusable code. I started by breaking down the problem into manageable components.

## What challenges did I have?
One challenge I faced was handling form validation errors. Initially, my error messages weren’t clear, which made it difficult for users to understand what needed to be fixed.


## What would I do differently now?
If I were to start over, I would spend more time in the planning phase to create detailed wireframes and user flow diagrams. This would help me anticipate potential problems in the form’s usability and layout.
